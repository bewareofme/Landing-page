It was a nice project to make me understand flexbox a lot better
before i had to put in the codes and see what will happen when i flex my items, now most of the time i have a mental image of what my code is going to do and
that helped me to code better and be less frustrated, it was a good project, though asetheically it can be improve, i feel progress
